Streams

These are Java stream exercises, the tasks are listed here.

Exercise 1:

Write a method to return a list of even numbers from the list of integers below using the Stream API.

Exercise 2:

Write a method to return a list of squares of positive numbers from the list of integers below using the Stream API.

Exercise 3:

Write a method to return a list of numbers whose square is greater than 20 from the list of integers below using the
Stream API. The value 20 should be one of the method's parameters.

Exercise 4:

Write a method to return the average of odd numbers in the list of integers below using the Stream API. Implement this
without calculating the sum first!

Exercise 5:

Write a method to return the sum of odd numbers in the list of integers below using the Stream API.

Exercise 6:

Write a method to return a list of uppercase characters from a given string using the Stream API.

Exercise 7:

Write a method to return a list of strings which start with the specified character (method parameter) using the
Stream API.

Exercise 8:

Write a method to return a string concatenated from a given list of characters using the Stream API.

Exercise 9:

Write a method to return a map specifying the frequency of characters in a given string using the Stream API.

Exercise 10:

Create a Fox class with 3 properties: name, color and age. Create a list of foxes and add at least 8 instances to it. 
Then, using the Stream API :
 - write a method to return a list of foxes of green color
 - write a method to return a list of foxes of green color younger than 5
 - write a method to return a map specifying the frequency of foxes by color

Exercise 11:

Find a random Wikipedia article and copy and save the contents to a text file.
Using the Stream API, write a method getWordFrequency which reads all text from the saved file and returns a map of 
word frequencies. Next, using getWordFrequency and Stream API, write a method to return an ordered list 
Entry<String, Long> of the most common words in descending order. Keep in mind that the text contains punctuation
characters which should be ignored. The result should be something like this:
