Data Structures

Java exercises regarding data structures, such as lists, maps and also diving into strings more. The exercises related
to strings will contain the description of the task inside the comments, and the exercises with data structures 
will be here:

List Introduction 1:

We are going to play with lists. Feel free to use the built-in methods where possible.

Create an empty list which will contain names (strings)
Print out the number of elements in the list
Add "William" to the list
Print out whether the list is empty or not
Add "John" to the list
Add "Amanda" to the list
Print out the number of elements in the list
Print out the 3rd element
Iterate through the list and print out each name
Iterate through the list and print
Remove the 2nd element
Iterate through the list in a reversed order and print out each name
Remove all elements
Print out the number of elements in the list

List Introduction 2:

Create a list ('List A') which contains the following values
    Apple, Avocado, Blueberries, Durian, Lychee
Create a new list ('List B') with the values of List A
Print out whether List A contains "Durian" or not
Remove "Durian" from List B
Add "Kiwifruit" to List A after the 4th element
Compare the size of List A and List B
Get the index of "Avocado" from List A
Get the index of "Durian" from List B
Add "Passion Fruit" and "Pomelo" to List B in a single statement
Print out the 3rd element from List A
Print all elements of List A
Print all elements of List B

Map Introduction 1:

We are going to play with maps. Feel free to use the built-in methods where possible.

Create an empty map where the keys are integers and the values are characters
Print out whether the map is empty or not
Add the following key-value pairs to the map
    Key	Value
    97	a
    98	b
    99	c
    65	A
    66	B
    67	C
Print all the keys
Print all the values
Add value D with the key 68
Print how many key-value pairs are in the map
Print the value that is associated with key 99
Remove the key-value pair with key 97
Print whether there is an associated value with key 100 or not
Remove all the key-value pairs
Print how many key-value pairs are in the map

Map Introduction 2:

Create a map where the keys are strings and the values are strings with the following initial values

    Key	Value
    978-1-60309-452-8	A Letter to Jo

    The Lab (ISBN: 978-1-60309-461-0)

Remove the key-value pair with key 978-1-60309-444-3
Remove the key-value pair with value The Lab
Add the following key-value pairs to the map

    Key	Value
    978-1-60309-450-4	They Called Us Enemy
    978-1-60309-453-5	Why Did We Trust Him?
